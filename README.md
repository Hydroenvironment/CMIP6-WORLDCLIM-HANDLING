üåè DAILY AND MONTHLY DATA TREATMENT FROM GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCMs) BY CMIP6 PHASE

‚úÖThe 2013 IPCC fifth assessment report (AR5) featured climate models from CMIP5, while the upcoming 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report (AR6) will feature new state-of-the-art CMIP6 models.

‚úÖCMIP6 will consist of the ‚Äúruns‚Äù from around 100 distinct climate models being produced across 49 different modelling groups. While the results from only around 40 CMIP6 models have been published so far, it is already evident that a number of them have a notably higher climate sensitivity than models in CMIP5

‚úÖThe overview paper on the CMIP6 experimental design and organization has now been published in GMD (Eyring et al., 2016). This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the CMIP Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) experiments and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 23 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.

‚úÖThe IPCC AR5 featured four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that examined different possible future greenhouse gas emissions. These scenarios ‚Äì RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 ‚Äì have new versions in CMIP6. These updated scenarios are called SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP4-6.0, and SSP5-8.5, each of which result in similar 2100 radiative forcing levels as their predecessor in AR5.
